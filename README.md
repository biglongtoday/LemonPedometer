![history](/image/history.png)

###Statement:
1. This Pedometer's algorithm is fork from bagilevi. You can look at it by [click me](https://github.com/bagilevi/android-pedometer). I recode the UI.

2. There still exists some bugs, which casue the apps can't work very well. Fixing it is on the way.

3. The apps is work offline at now. And it store data using sqlite. And I will change the work mode.
